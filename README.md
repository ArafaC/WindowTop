## NOTE
This source code is provided to you for free in the hope that you will be able to be convinced that there is no any malicious code included.

Because the software is written in Autoit and being very pupular, I could not able to deal with the "suspicious program" concern that some users have. The thing that changed the game was the fact that Google.Com mistakenly blocked the software website due to "suspicious program" concern.
